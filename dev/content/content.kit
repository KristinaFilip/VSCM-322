        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>My name is Kristina Filip and I am currently a student at Drexel University studying Graphic Design.
            Collaboration, creativity, and problem solving are important parts of being a graphic designer that I value.
            I enjoy coming up with creative solutions to problems and always encourage myself to tackle challenging
            projects with these values in mind. I continuously strive to improve my graphic design skills and am willing
            to learn new things along the way. Outside of designing, I enjoy reading books and graphic novels, spending
            time with my family, and photography.</p>
